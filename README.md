## Crypto exercises

This is a repo where I try to work out some functions for cryptoanalysis intended to solve simpler ciphers like
Caesar or Vigen√©re.

Uses

* Chi square method to solve caesar
* Caesar shift
* Kasiski examination to analyse repeated n-grams of characters in order to find keylength for vigenere.
